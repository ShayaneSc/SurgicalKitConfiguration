# Data Instance Repository - [Surgical Kit Configuration Problem by Mixed-Integer Linear Programming and a Graph-based Heuristic]

This repository contains the data instances used in the article "Surgical Kit Configuration Problem by Mixed-Integer Linear Programming and a Graph-based Heuristic".

# Description

The data instances in this repository are provided in CSV format and represent quantities of different types of medical items used in surgical procedures. These data were used to validate the optimization approaches proposed for the surgical kit configuration problem, as described in the article.

The “Instances” folder contains 20 files with the proposed instances for the computational experiments of the article. Of these, half of the files correspond to medical supplies and medications, and the other half correspond to medical supply data.

Each instance in a .csv file contains data regarding the quantities of types of items used in each surgical procedure. A fictitious name “item_{i}” was given to maintain data privacy, where {i} varies up to the total number of item types needed for each procedure. In the last row of the file, named ‘freq_procedure’, the quantities of times the procedure was performed during the period considered in the article are indicated.
